# Kaybee

Kaybee is a lightweight, standalone Kanban board that runs entirely in your browser. It is designed to be a simple, offline-capable tool for personal task management.

## Features

- **Headless & Offline**: No backend server or database required. All data is stored locally in your browser (LocalStorage).
- **Drag & Drop**: Easily move cards between columns and organize your board.
- **Customizable**: Add as many columns as you need.
- **Card Styling**: Color-code your cards and toggle between a fun handwritten font and a clean, readable sans-serif font.
- **Zero Setup**: Just open `index.html` to get started.

## Usage

1.  **Open**: Double-click `index.html` to launch the board in your default web browser.
2.  **Add Columns**: Use the `+` button in the header to create new columns.
3.  **Add Cards**: Click the `+` inside any column to add a task card.
4.  **Edit**: Click on card text to edit. Click color dots to change card color.
5.  **Delete**: Drag a card to the trash zone in the bottom right corner to remove it.
6.  **Reset**: Use the "Reset" button to clear the board and start fresh.

## Privacy

Since Kaybee is headless, your data never leaves your device. It persists in your browser's storage until you clear it.
